    <h3>My Third Heading</h3>

    <p>Hello, fellas! My name is rizqifathrr. I welcome you all to The Learn How to Build a Web. It's my personal page
        as a place where I'll learn to build websites from scratch, like a documenter stuff. What you currently read is
        my very first paragraph on this page. I wrote this paragraph with visual code in intention to learn a new skill
        while practising my English. I hope learning this skill will do me good and grant me goodnes for good. It may
        look awful at first, but at least it's honest.</p>
    <p>The tutor web i use to learn told me to type another paragraph for example.</p>

    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="blank">If you click this sentence, it's suppose to open the Youtube home
        page. Be my guest, please!</a>

    <br> <p>Say 'Hi!' to my favourite baby image and video i found from the internet!</p>

    <p>This is a <br> paragraph with a line break.</p>
    <h1 style="color: rgb(100, 28, 47); font-weight: bolder;">I'm fond of this red-purple-ish color!</h1>
    <p title="Great! This little box thing with a sentence inside is called Tooltip... cute!">Hover the cursor of yours
        to this sentence!</p>

    <h1 style="font-size: 45px;">This is supposed to be a lot bigger than the one underneath.</h1>
    <h1>The one underneath.</h1>

    <p>I've made a numerous paragraph tags on this page but the tutor told me to make some other paragraphs for the sake
        of education. Thus, this is my another paragraph number #oneneverknows. Heck, i dont even know what else i have
        to write but i want to try how many words do my screen can fit in one line. I hope this sentence already in the
        third or fourth lines because it would be so much cool to be seen if you have a long text for your page. It
        looks 'informative'.</p>
    <p>Great, thrid line it is!</p>
    <hr>
    <p>There must be a straight ruler line on top of this sentence.</p>
    <br>

    <h3>Theoretically, i can devide things into some sections with that line.</h3>
    <p>Let's give it a try!</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>I hope it'll works.</h3>
    <p>Great, as you can see!</p>

    <h3>New section, new thing to learn!</h3>

    <p>So, there's a problem with html when you try to type a poetic style sentence. Like we all would already know, a
        poem usually has multiple lines or spaces, with each line only contain a few words in it. You want your poem to
        looks aesthetic with several line break each short sentence. Thus, we can use the 'pre' tags. Lets give it a
        try!</p>
    <pre>
        "One day,"    you said to me,    "I saw the sunset forty-four times!"
        
        And a little later you added:
        
        "You know--one loves the sunset, when one is so sad ..."
        
        "Were you so sad, then?"    I asked,    "on the day of the forty-four sunsets?"
        
        But the little prince    made no reply.

    <a href="Q:\X - PROJECT\HOW TO BUILD A WEB\Learn to Build a Web (blue).html">By clicking this sentence, the page's
        background should be pink at a time.</a>
    <h3 style="background-color: hotpink;">Ooh, looks like a highlighter things!</h3>
    <p style="background-color: tomato;">Visual Code calls this color 'tomato'... queer, indeed.</p>
    <hr>

    <p style="color: darkred;">In this section, the tutor i use mentions the CSS terms and i dont even know what the
        fuck is CSS</p>
    <p style="font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif;">Franklin Gothic Medium, Arial
        Narrow, Arial, sans-serif. <br> What a long name for a simple font style, incidentally, you might wanna look to
        the right side of your screen.</p>
    <p style="text-align: right;">Greetings!</p>
    <a href="Q:\X - PROJECT\HOW TO BUILD A WEB\Learn to Build a Web (center-align).html"
        style="display: block; text-align: right;">Wow, i can align all this content to the center at once by adding the
        attribute inside the body tag! Interesting.</a>
    <p style="text-align: right;">Another interesting fact, i must add 'style=display: block' attribute to set the (a)
        tags text-align :)</p>

    <hr>
    <h3></h3>
    <b>It's suppose to be bold style text.</b> <br>
    <strong>This one uses 'strong' tag. Never know what's the difference</strong> <br><br>
    <i>Have u ever wonder why they called this one italic?</i> <br>
    <em>The resemblance is crystal clear!</em><br><br>
    <small>One day i'll grow big.</small><br>

    <h3>Inside this 'blockquote' tag underneath, there's a 'cite' attribute attached to The Little Prince e-book that you can find on internet, but i have no idea if that tag has good or not.</h2>
    <blockquote cite="https://blogs.ubc.ca/edcp508/files/2016/02/TheLittlePrince.pdf" style="text-align: justify;">
        "My life is very monotonous," the fox said. "I hunt chickens; men hunt me. All the chickens are just alike, and all the men are just alike. And, in consequence, I am a little bored. But if you tame me, it will be as if the sun came to shine on my life. I shall know the sound of a step that will be different from all the others. Other steps send me hurrying back underneath the ground. Yours will call me, like music, out of my burrow. And then look: you see the grain-fields down yonder? I do not eat bread. Wheat is of no use to me. The wheat fields have nothing to say to me. And that is sad. But you have hair that is the color of gold. Think how wonderful that will be when you have tamed me! The grain, which is also golden, will bring me back the thought of you. And I shall love to listen to the wind in the wheat . . ."

    <q>This one uses the 'q' tag to make the sentence got wedged between quotation mark. <a style="color: red; font-size: large;">Why dont we just type this bloody </a><a style="font-size: large;">" </a> <a style="color: red; font-size: large;">?!</a></q>
    <p>Well, it's a little bit <abbr title="kontol">KNTL </abbr> <abbr title="anjing">ANJG </abbr> <abbr title="bangsat">BGST</abbr> when you must add the 'abbr' tag when you want to type any abbreviation or acronym.</p>
